As part of this exercise can you please create the following:
1. A design of what information the new staff member onboarding form should contain. This
can be completed as: written text, drawn on paper (and scanned) or built in
HTML/Javascript.

Designed is deployed here: https://apuri04.github.io/assessment/

2. Regarding the design above, please outline your reasons for the design choices you made.

The idea that comes in my mind, while starting the design is as follows: 
 simple interface , consistency, choice of colours and textures, typography, clarity and hierarchy. 
There are many choices, when it comes to design. The reason, I choose the one I drew is becuase it is the most common and simple one. There are many other fields that could be nice to have. However, to avoid boredom, filling up the long forms . I have only included the important information.

The other way for the design would be small modal on multiple pages > 1. Personal Info  -- Next >> 2. Address -- >> Next page 3. Bank Details --- and the finish at the last page.

3. A program to calculate the annual tax and superannuation for a given salary (please see rate
table below). This can be deployed using Java or Javascript.

A simple program to write a program, is written in script.js file

4. A few written or programmed tests to prove the tax and superannuation calculations
